# Reporting module

## Purpose

Turn a deterministic inspection `findings.json` artifact into advisory,
customer-readable output. The module never performs inspection, changes findings, reads
BigQuery rows, or applies remediation.

Architecture decisions: [ADR-0004](../../../docs/adr/0004-isolate-ai-report-generation.md)
and [ADR-0005](../../../docs/adr/0005-render-remediation-drafts-from-recipes.md).

## Public API

| Entry point | Layer | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `InspectionArtifact`, `GeneratedNarrative`, `ReportLanguage` | domain | Validated CHK-01..CHK-13 input, fixed `en` / `ja` language, and provider-output vocabulary |
| `GenerateAiReport.handle(input_path, out_dir, language=en)` | application | Read, pseudonymize, generate in the fixed language, validate, and write |
| `GenerateRemediationDraft.handle(input_path, out_dir)` | application | Read, select versioned recipes, and write a deterministic draft |
| \`task report-ai FINDINGS=<json> REPORT_LANGUAGE=en | ja\` | interface |
| `task remediation-draft FINDINGS=<json>` | interface | Offline deterministic CLI; writes `remediation-draft.md` |
| `examples/reporting/` | example | Public synthetic report pack for offline review; never Acceptance evidence |

## Owned data

No persistent state. It reads one inspection artifact and owns only the generated
`ai-report.md` and `remediation-draft.md` files written beneath a caller-selected
directory.

## Invariants

1. The model receives aliases, check enums, coverage counts, and approved static guidance
   only; never artifact free text, project/resource identifiers, observed values, rows,
   credentials, or skipped error details.
2. Provider output cannot add, remove, reclassify, or resolve findings. Every expected
   finding reference appears exactly once.
3. `findings.json` and `summary.md` are never changed.
4. Existing output files fail closed and are never overwritten.
5. Provider or writer failure leaves no partial report and never makes deterministic
   inspection artifacts unusable.
6. Remediation code and policy examples come only from versioned local recipes; the model
   and artifact free text never select or populate code.
7. Remediation output is deterministic, non-applying Markdown with explicit placeholders.
8. Unsupported check IDs fail closed. CHK-12 and CHK-13 use only static guidance and
   local, non-applying remediation recipes; artifact free text never becomes guidance
   or code. CHK-13 asks for a structured promotion-source declaration and separate
   human review of the transformation; it never presents that declaration as verified
   SQL lineage.
9. Report language is the fixed `en` / `ja` enum; caller-provided free text never becomes
   a language instruction. English remains the default for backward compatibility. The
   selected language controls provider narratives and locally rendered fixed labels only.
