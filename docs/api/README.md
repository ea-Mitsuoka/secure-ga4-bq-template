# API Documentation

Contracts for every interface this system exposes (HTTP, events, CLI).

**Update triggers (DOC-030):** any change to a public endpoint, event schema, CLI
command, or error contract. Breaking contract changes additionally require the
`BREAKING CHANGE:` commit footer (WF-020) and consumer migration notes.

## Rules

- **Schema first**: the machine-readable contract (OpenAPI 3.x at `openapi.yaml`,
  AsyncAPI for events, JSON Schema for payloads) is the source of truth; prose
  commentary supplements, never contradicts.
- Contract tests verify implementation against the schema (TST-001 integration level);
  drift between schema and implementation is a CI failure, not a doc chore.
- Every endpoint documents: auth requirement (SEC-020), inputs with validation rules,
  outputs, **every error response** with its trigger condition, idempotency, rate limits.
- Examples use obviously fake credentials (GR-002) and realistic payloads.
- Versioning: breaking API changes follow expand→migrate→contract (REL-040); document
  deprecation windows here.

## Structure

| File | Content |
| -- | -- |
| `openapi.yaml` | HTTP API contract (source of truth) |
| `events.md` / `asyncapi.yaml` | Published/consumed events |
| [`report-ai-cli.md`](report-ai-cli.md) | `task report-ai` inputs, outputs, auth, and exit codes |
| `errors.md` | Error catalog: code → meaning → caller action |
| `changelog.md` | Contract-level changes and deprecation schedule |

## GitHub governance CLI

`scripts/github_governance.py` resolves the inherited policy and exposes four commands:

| Command | Authentication | Behavior | Exit codes |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `validate` | none | offline policy validation | 0 valid; 2 error |
| `plan` | repository read; Administration read for complete vulnerability-alert state | GET-only redacted comparison | 0 complete; 2 error |
| `audit` | same as `plan` | same GET-only comparison as a compliance gate | 0 compliant; 1 drift/unknown; 2 error |
| `apply` | repository Administration write | confirmed, verified policy application | 0 compliant; 2 error |

`apply` requires `--repo OWNER/REPOSITORY` and an exactly equal `--confirm-repo`.
Missing or unequal values fail before GitHub discovery. Authentication MUST come from a
local interactive `gh` session; CI, scheduled execution, and GitHub Actions
Administration credentials are prohibited by ADR-0009.

After initial discovery, `apply` refreshes state and replans before its first write. It
then writes one action, reads affected controls back, verifies them, and replans. It can
change branch merge requirements, secret scanning, push protection, merged-branch
deletion, Dependabot vulnerability alerts, private vulnerability reporting, and the
separately selected Dependabot security-update setting. Vulnerability alerts and private
reporting are enable-only `SEC-003` minimums; selecting Renovate still keeps Dependabot
automated security updates disabled. Output is deterministic JSON. Failures after
execution preparation include redacted `attempted_actions`, `verified_actions`,
`failure_phase`, and `failed_action` evidence; earlier input, policy, or discovery
failures report an error without partial evidence. The command never retries or rolls
back automatically.

Every live target and run requires separate authorization after GET-only `plan` review.
The command's availability does not authorize a live run.

## Engagement qualification CLI

```bash
task qualify-inspection-scope \
  MENU_PROFILE=service-packages/inspection-standard.yml \
  SCOPE=engagement-scope.example.yml \
  MENU_OUT=reports/service-packaging
```

The local command evaluates one anonymous schema-v1 scope against one schema-v1 menu
profile. It requires no authentication, cloud access, AI provider, or environment
variable.

| Input | Default | Validation |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `MENU_PROFILE` | `service-packages/inspection-standard.yml` | complete schema-v1 profile with all evaluator condition IDs |
| `SCOPE` | `engagement-scope.example.yml` | positive counts, Boolean special-condition flags, and no unknown fields |
| `MENU_OUT` | `reports/service-packaging` | writable local directory without either output filename |

The command writes byte-deterministic `qualification.json` and `qualification.md` with
the profile identity, supplied scope, eligibility, and every ordered reason. Existing
output fails before publication; a pair-publication failure rolls back files created by
that invocation.

| Exit | Meaning | Caller action |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 0 | both artifacts written | review the qualification before preparing a proposal |
| 2 | invalid/missing input, existing output, or local I/O failure | correct the named path or field and rerun in an empty output location |

The result is preflight sales-support information. It is not collected customer
metadata, an inspection finding, a final price, or approval to perform work.
