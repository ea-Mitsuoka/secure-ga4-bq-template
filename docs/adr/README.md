# Secure GA4 BigQuery Template Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains decisions owned by `secure-ga4-bq-template`. Inherited foundation
decisions from the direct parent chain are synchronized under
[`docs/foundation/adr/`](../foundation/adr/).

## Rules

- Numbered sequentially: `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`. Copy the
  [foundation ADR template](../foundation/templates/adr.md).
- Status flow: `proposed → accepted | rejected`; later `deprecated` or
  `superseded by ADR-NNNN`. **Accepted ADRs are never edited** — supersede them.
- One decision per ADR. Keep it under ~2 pages.
- The ADR PR is approved by a human before implementation starts (GR-022).
- Every ADR gets a line in [.ai/decision-log.md](../../.ai/decision-log.md).
