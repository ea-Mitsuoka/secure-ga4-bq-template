# Development Handoff

This document records the durable repository state needed to resume work without the
conversation that produced it. Requirements, decisions, and dated evidence remain
authoritative in their linked documents.

## Snapshot

| Item | State on 2026-08-10 | Evidence or source |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Default branch | Release baseline v2.11.0 | [Release v2.11.0](https://github.com/Yukihide-Mitsuoka/secure-ga4-bq-template/releases/tag/v2.11.0) |
| Direct parent lock | `terraform-gcp-template` at `8f15dd548ef8dd86192b2bc1440b6ef40fa8bdc2`; PR #308 merged and Issue #309 closed | [Inheritance lock](../.github/inheritance/lock.json), [PR #308](https://github.com/Yukihide-Mitsuoka/secure-ga4-bq-template/pull/308) |
| IaC governance prerequisite | Complete: exact `iac-scan` succeeded on PR #125 and its merged-main push | [PR run](https://github.com/Yukihide-Mitsuoka/secure-ga4-bq-template/actions/runs/29517379947), [main run](https://github.com/Yukihide-Mitsuoka/secure-ga4-bq-template/actions/runs/29518413106) |
| Active work | PR #317 and Issue #316 are complete. PR #319 and Issue #318 propose making `intermediate` optional while preserving the v2 default to prevent unintended Dataset deletion. ADR-0012 is awaiting repository-owner review; implementation must remain a separate PR after approval. No cloud resource is required. Acceptance S remains condition-gated. | [PR #319](https://github.com/Yukihide-Mitsuoka/secure-ga4-bq-template/pull/319), [Issue #318](https://github.com/Yukihide-Mitsuoka/secure-ga4-bq-template/issues/318), [ADR-0012](adr/0012-make-intermediate-layer-optional.md), [System overview](requirements/README.md) |
| Repository visibility | Public; project/resource IDs are not treated as secrets, but raw inspection artifacts remain Internal | [Security guidance](../.ai/security.md) |
| Acceptance B | Complete: 11/11 checks proven deterministically and 8/11 live | [B evidence](verification/2026-07-12-inspection-engine-b-evidence.md) |
| Technical Acceptance A | APPROVED on 2026-07-15: public-source materialization, WIF cost gate, 100% inspection, remediation draft, one AI report, and teardown completed | [Accepted evidence](verification/2026-07-15-public-ga4-acceptance-a-evidence.md) |
| Acceptance boundary | Approval is constrained to the public sample, interactive ADC inspection, and an inspector WIF path that was not invoked; it is not customer-engagement evidence | [Evidence limitations](verification/2026-07-15-public-ga4-acceptance-a-evidence.md#limitations-and-human-decision) |
| Mart-description governance | Complete: CHK-12 retains table/view and leaf-column descriptions and reports missing metadata without changing the historical Acceptance B denominator | [Issue #70](https://github.com/Yukihide-Mitsuoka/secure-ga4-bq-template/issues/70), [inspection design](requirements/design-inspection-engine.md) |
| Promotion-source governance | Complete: catalog v2 records source-agnostic field path/key declarations and CHK-13 reports incomplete declarations for observed promoted mart columns without parsing descriptions, rows, or SQL | [ADR-0011](adr/0011-record-structured-promoted-column-lineage.md), [inspection design](requirements/design-inspection-engine.md) |
| Column masking | Issue #232 and PR #233 complete: default-off Terraform integration, clear/masked/denied behavior, bounded cost, and teardown proven with synthetic data | [Issue #232](https://github.com/Yukihide-Mitsuoka/secure-ga4-bq-template/issues/232), [live evidence](verification/2026-07-23-column-masking-live-evidence.md) |
| Acceptance S | Not started; requires a second engagement or department-standard adoption | [Main requirements section 8](requirements/requirements-secure-asset.md) |
| Cloud baseline | Restored: both verification projects have no BigQuery datasets including anonymous datasets and no active verification SA/IAM; the new project retains only its pre-existing SA and two GCS buckets | [Column-masking teardown](verification/2026-07-23-column-masking-live-evidence.md) |
| Unrelated shared assets | `github-actions-pool` ACTIVE, `github-actions-deployer` enabled, and `TEMPLATE_SYNC_ENABLED=true` unchanged | Same teardown evidence |

`gcp-cicd-workflows` v2 remains the external reusable-workflow dependency. The cost-gate
caller and WIF condition are pinned together to `v2.0.2`.

## Next work

No cloud action is required. Continue in this order:

1. Review ADR-0012. If accepted, implement Issue #318 in a separate PR; do not change the v2
   default or automatically remove an existing `intermediate` Dataset.
2. Use the requirements system overview as the entry point for future customer scoping. Keep
   all later Template Sync changes review-gated.
3. Re-run the GET-only governance planner before any settings change. Treat every live
   target and run as separately approval-gated; implementation merge is not
   authorization for `apply`.
4. Apply the asset to a second engagement only when an owner, target scope, customer
   data approval, and cloud-cost approval exist, then measure reuse effort for
   Acceptance S.
5. Use the versioned standard-inspection profile, generated menu, and deterministic
   qualification artifacts as the service-packaging baseline; change profile values in
   a reviewed PR rather than editing generated material.
6. Keep customer delivery evidence and raw inspection artifacts outside this public
   repository because complete inspection artifacts remain Internal.

Do not recreate the deleted verification environment unless a new issue and approvals
require it.

The `github-ga4v58` WIF pool ID remains reserved as a harmless DELETED tombstone during
Google's undelete window. Do not reuse that ID during the window.

## Durable results

| Result | Value |
| -- | -- |
| Public source | `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce` in `US` |
| Actual BigQuery processing | 1,604,088,078 bytes; billed 1,604,321,280 bytes |
| Dedicated WIF cost gate | Three SQL files passed the 2,000,000,000-byte per-file ceiling |
| Inspection coverage | 3 datasets, 3 tables/views, 19 columns, 0 skipped |
| Reporting | Deterministic JSON/CSV/Markdown inspection outputs and remediation plus one non-authoritative AI draft |
| CHK-12 | Implemented through the specification, reporting, and inspection slices; no query jobs or additional cloud resources |
| CHK-13 | Implemented through ADR, catalog, reporting, inspection, and standard-profile slices; source declarations are source-agnostic and do not prove SQL lineage |
| Service packaging | Versioned standard profile, customer-menu renderer, deterministic scope evaluator, and rollback-safe JSON/Markdown qualification publication |
| Column masking | Default-off opt-in integrated; clear/masked/denied paths passed with 300 processed bytes and 31,457,280 billed bytes |
| Teardown | Current 20-resource proof, its anonymous query datasets, and four historical anonymous verification datasets removed; both projects show zero BigQuery datasets |

Artifact hashes and exact run links live only in the dated evidence to avoid duplicate
sources of truth.

## New-machine resume procedure

Use [Usage](foundation/guides/usage.md), then run:

```bash
gh auth status
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
task setup
task doctor
task format
task lint
task test
task build
git status --short --branch
```

Credentials remain machine-local and must never be committed. Optional local scanners
may be absent; CI remains authoritative.

## Resume prompt

> Read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.ai/guardrails.md`, `.ai/README.md`, and
> `docs/development-handoff.md`. Confirm the v2.11.0 release baseline and direct-parent lock
> `8f15dd548ef8dd86192b2bc1440b6ef40fa8bdc2`. Read the requirements system overview before
> translating a customer request into implementation inputs. Verify Issue #306's ordered lock
> acceptance, synchronized fleet-audit guidance, and direct Scorecard boundary. Preserve the leaf-specific release
> workflow and Scorecard v4 dependency as explicit manual-review boundaries. Keep the
> protected leaf regression and completed one-first-parent acceptance. Preserve the
> read-only fleet report, schema v2 profile, and identity-free adapter without regressing
> PR #280's accepted contract contents. Keep the child-specific governance
> planner authoritative with `iac-scan` preserved. Do not run governance `apply` or
> mutate live GitHub/GCP state without a fresh GET-only plan and separate
> target-specific approval. Technical Acceptance A, CHK-12, CHK-13, opt-in column
> masking, service packaging, and release hardening are complete. Continue toward Acceptance S
> only when a second engagement or department-standard owner, scope, customer-data
> approval, and cloud-cost approval exist. Do not recreate the deleted verification
> environment without a new issue and approvals.
